## **Step-by-Step Guide**


<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Access the Integrations Dashboard">
    1. **Log in** to Autoppia Studio.  
    2. From the main dashboard or sidebar, **navigate to ‚ÄúIntegrations.‚Äù**  
    3. Toggle between **grid view** and **list view** if needed (top-right icons).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Step 2: Understanding the Interface">
    - **Integration Cards** show the service type (API, PostgreSQL, SMTP, etc.) and its current status.  
    - Use the **filter dropdown** to show specific categories like databases, messaging services, or web apps.  
    - **Hide inactive integrations** by enabling the toggle switch.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Step 3: Adding a New Integration">
    1. Click the **‚Äú+‚Äù Card** to add a new integration.  
    2. Select the desired service type:  
      - **API (REST or GraphQL)**  
      - **Database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)**  
      - **SMTP (Email)**  
      - **Web App**  

    3. Follow the configuration prompts:  
      - For APIs: Provide the base URL, headers, and authentication details.  
      - For databases: Enter the connection string, username, and password.  
      - For SMTP: Configure the SMTP server, port, and credentials.

    4. **Test the connection** using the built-in testing tool.  
    5. **Save and confirm** the integration.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 4: Activating an Integration">
    - Locate the integration on the dashboard.  
    - If the status shows as **"Inactive"**, toggle the switch to **‚ÄúActive.‚Äù**  
    - **Test the integration** to ensure it's working as expected.

    > üí° **Tip:** APIs often require testing endpoints using external tools like **Postman** or **Hoppscotch** after activation.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 5: Deactivating or Removing an Integration">
    1. Locate the integration card and toggle its status to **Inactive**.  
    2. (Optional) To permanently **remove the integration**:  
      - Click the card to open its settings.  
      - Select the **delete option** and confirm.
<Warning>üö® **Warning:** Deleting an integration may result in lost configurations. Ensure you have backups of sensitive settings like API keys and database credentials.</Warning>

      </Step>

  <Step title="Step 6: Filtering and Searching">
    1. **Category Filter:** Use the dropdown to select a category like APIs, databases, or messaging.  
    2. **Hide inactive integrations** by enabling the toggle to reduce clutter.  
    3. Use the **search bar** (if available) to find integrations by name.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 7: Testing and Debugging Integrations">
    1. **For APIs:**  
      - Use API testing tools like **Postman** or **Hoppscotch**.  
      - Test GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to ensure endpoint functionality.  

    2. **For Databases:**  
      - Run sample queries to confirm proper connectivity and data retrieval.  

    3. **For SMTP:**  
      - Send test emails and verify email delivery logs.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 8: Monitoring and Managing Integration Health">
    - Regularly monitor **API rate limits** and error responses.  
    - Use built-in or external monitoring tools to detect connectivity issues.  
    - Maintain **logs for all key operations** to facilitate quick troubleshooting.
  </Step>
</Steps>
