General purpose Language Models have transformed task automation and problem-solving activities. However, orchestration is essential to developing fully functional AI systems that can perform real-world actions and engage in meaningful collaboration with humans. We refer to this orchestration of technologies and tools as AI Workers.
 
## What are AI Workers?

AI Workers are intelligent digital assistants designed to augment human capabilities, collaborate on complex tasks, and autonomously complete various activities. They represent a new paradigm in human-AI interaction, offering three primary modes of operation, namely: 


- Human-AI collaboration
- Autonomous Execution
- Task Automation

AI workers are similar to “agents,” but they are applied to core business tasks like back-office work or management issues. The idea is to provide workers with tools and software connectivity to perform their tasks seamlessly.

<Tip>AI Workers bridge the gap between powerful language models and practical, real-world applications, making advanced AI capabilities accessible and actionable for businesses and individuals alike </Tip>



## AI Worker Mode of Operation

As we mentioned earlier, AI workers offers three modes of operation. 
These generally empowers Human-AI collaboration. In this section, we will briefly discuss those Operations.
