## **A**  
**API**  
A set of functions and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate and interact with each other.

**Automation**  
The process of creating software scripts or systems that perform tasks without human intervention.



## **B**  
**Bot**  
An autonomous or semi-autonomous software program designed to automate repetitive tasks, often used in testing environments.

**Build Pipeline**  
A series of steps through which code passes to ensure functionality, testing, and deployment in software development.



## **C**  
**CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)**  
A software development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed to ensure faster and more reliable releases.

**Code Coverage**  
A measure that describes the percentage of source code executed during testing to assess test effectiveness.



## **D**  
**Deployment**  
The process of delivering a software product or update to users or a production environment.

**Documentation**  
A set of instructions and reference materials provided to explain how to use or develop a software product.



## **E**  
**End-to-End Testing**  
A testing methodology that validates the entire software workflow, from input to final output, simulating real-world scenarios.



## **F**  
**Framework**  
A reusable software environment that provides a foundation and set of rules for building and developing applications efficiently.



## **G**  
**GitHub**  
A cloud-based platform for version control and collaboration, allowing developers to work together on projects from anywhere.



## **H**  
**Headless Automation**  
The execution of browser tests or web interactions without a graphical user interface (GUI), often used to speed up testing.



## **I**  
**Integration Testing**  
A level of software testing where individual components are combined and tested as a group to evaluate interactions and data flow.



## **J**  
**JavaScript**  
A high-level programming language commonly used for developing dynamic web pages and applications.



## **K**  
**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**  
Metrics used to evaluate the performance and success of a process, tool, or system in meeting defined objectives.



## **L**  
**Load Testing**  
A type of performance testing that evaluates how a system behaves under expected or high load conditions.



## **M**  
**Mock Data**  
Fake or simulated data used in testing environments to mimic real-world conditions without affecting production.



## **N**  
**Node.js**  
An open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side.



## **O**  
**OpenAPI**  
A specification for building and describing RESTful APIs, providing a standard way to document APIs using JSON or YAML files.



## **P**  
**Pipeline**  
A sequence of automated processes (such as building, testing, and deploying) designed to ensure continuous delivery of software updates.



## **Q**  
**Quality Assurance (QA)**  
A systematic process aimed at ensuring software products meet specified requirements and are free of defects.



## **R**  
**Regression Testing**  
A type of testing performed to ensure that changes to the codebase do not negatively impact existing functionality.

**REST API**  
A widely used API design approach that relies on stateless, client-server communication over HTTP.



## **S**  
**Selenium**  
An open-source testing framework used for automating web browsers to test web applications.

**Stress Testing**  
A testing technique used to evaluate how a system performs under extreme load or unfavorable conditions.



## **T**  
**Test Case**  
A set of conditions or variables used to determine whether a software system works as expected.

**Test Suite**  
A collection of test cases organized to validate specific functionality or features of a software system.



## **U**  
**Unit Testing**  
A software testing method where individual components or functions of an application are tested in isolation.

**User Story**  
A short, simple description of a feature or functionality from the perspective of the end user.



## **V**  
**Version Control**  
A system that records changes to files or projects over time, enabling teams to track and revert changes if needed.



## **W**  
**Webhooks**  
A way for an application to send real-time notifications or data to another service when an event occurs.



## **X**  
**XML (eXtensible Markup Language)**  
A markup language used to define structured data, often used in web development, API responses, and configuration files.



## **Y**  
**YAML (YAML Ainâ€™t Markup Language)**  
A human-readable data serialization standard used to define configuration files, particularly in software development and APIs.



## **Z**  
**Zero Downtime Deployment**  
A deployment strategy that ensures applications remain available during updates, avoiding downtime or interruptions.
